# AI-powered Service Business Automation Platform

This platform provides an intelligent automation solution for service businesses, leveraging AI agents to handle customer service, scheduling, billing, and document management tasks.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized AI agents for different business functions
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Create and manage complex business workflows
- **Dashboard Interface**: Monitor and control the automation system
- **API-First Design**: Extensible API for integration with other systems

## Agent Types

- **Customer Service Agent**: Handles customer inquiries, complaints, and feedback
- **Scheduling Agent**: Manages appointments, availability, and reminders
- **Billing Agent**: Processes invoices, payments, and financial reporting
- **Document Agent**: Generates and analyzes documents and contracts
- **Workflow Orchestrator**: Coordinates tasks between specialized agents

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the platform. You'll be automatically redirected to the dashboard.

## Architecture

The platform is built on a modular architecture:

1. **Core Agent Framework**: Defines the base agent interfaces and communication system
2. **Specialized Agents**: Implements domain-specific functionality
3. **Workflow Engine**: Orchestrates complex business processes
4. **API Layer**: Provides RESTful endpoints for agent and workflow management
5. **Dashboard UI**: Offers a user-friendly interface for monitoring and control

## Creating Workflows

Workflows can be created through the dashboard interface or via the API. A workflow consists of a series of steps, each assigned to a specific agent type with defined dependencies between steps.

Example workflow for client onboarding:

1. Customer Service Agent: Collect client information
2. Document Agent: Generate service agreement
3. Billing Agent: Set up payment information
4. Scheduling Agent: Book initial consultation

## Development

The project uses Next.js with TypeScript and follows a modular architecture. Key directories:

- `/src/lib/agents`: Core agent framework and specialized agents
- `/src/lib/db`: Database schema and models
- `/src/app/api`: API routes for agents, workflows, and tasks
- `/src/app/dashboard`: Dashboard UI components
